	<h1>What is Pangea</h1>
</center>


<h1>Pangea was a supercontinent that existed during the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic eras, approximately 335 million years ago. It was comprised of all the major continents we know today, including North America, South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, and Australia.
The formation of Pangea is believed to have been caused by plate tectonics, which caused the Earth's landmasses to slowly move together over millions of years. The collision of these landmasses created a single, massive continent that covered nearly one-third of the Earth's surface.</h1>
